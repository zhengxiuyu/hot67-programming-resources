# C++ Guided Tutorial #

New programmers should start here. This will guide you through [the tutorial at cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial), as well as provide assignments to apply and test your knowledge.

Seriously. Code right. You never know where those pesky velociraptors might be hiding.

_Some C++ assignments were adapted from web resources [here](http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/articles/12974/) and [here](http://www.math.ucla.edu/~wittman/10a.1.10w/Homework/HW7/homework7.html)_

# WPILib Tutorial #

This is for programmers who have the basics of C++ down.

This is written by a student, and as such is not written by nor endorsed by WPI.

It is intended to be easy for new robot programmers to understand. If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or suggestions, leave them in the comments on the page it applies to. _(You must [sign in to Google](https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?service=code&ltmpl=phosting&continue=http%3A%2F%2Fcode.google.com%2Fp%2Fhot67-programming-resources%2Fwiki%2FMain_Page&followup=http%3A%2F%2Fcode.google.com%2Fp%2Fhot67-programming-resources%2Fwiki%2FMain_Page) to leave comments)_

## Note to other teams ##

If you're from another team, cool! I hope you find this tutorial useful. However, I would like to point out that some of the activities are optimized for the resources we have available for training new team members (largely robots from previous years). I encourage you to adjust these activities to fit the needs of your team. Please talk to a mentor or an experienced team member about what you should do.

Also note that this tutorial teaches to program directly into the `BuiltinDefaultCode` template provided by WindRiver. While there are a few notes for the style provided by RobotBuilder, programming using that method is not explored in this tutorial.
