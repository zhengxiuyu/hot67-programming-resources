## User Info ##

Write a program that asks for a user first name, last name, street number, street name, city, state, zip code, phone number, and favorite flavor of bubble gum separately. Use a structure to store this info.

Then create a menu (like the one below) to allow the user to choose which piece of data from the structure to view.  Once a selection has been made display the piece of data.

```
What would you like to know about //(Display first and last name here):

1. Full Address
2. Phone Number
3. Favorite flavor of bubble gum

>>> //1, 2, or 3
```

You may want to take a look at [input validation](CPP_TipsAndTricks#Input_Validation.md).

### Extra Practice ###

Allow the user to input information on any number of people. (HINT: use an array!)
