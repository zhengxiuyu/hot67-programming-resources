_Note to other teams: If you're from another team, cool! I hope you find this tutorial useful. However, I would like to point out that some of the activities are optimized for the resources we have available for training new team members (largely robots from previous years). I encourage you to adjust these activities to fit the needs of your team. Please talk to a mentor or an experienced team member about what you should do._
