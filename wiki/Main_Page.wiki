Seriously. Code right. You never know where those pesky velociraptors might be hiding.

_Some C++ assignments were adapted from web resources [http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/articles/12974/ here] and [http://www.math.ucla.edu/~wittman/10a.1.10w/Homework/HW7/homework7.html here]_

=WPILib Tutorial=

This is for programmers who have the basics of C++ down.

_Note to other teams: If you're from another team, cool! I hope you find this tutorial useful. However, I would like to point out that some of the activities are optimized for the resources we have available for training new team members (largely robots from previous years). I encourage you to adjust these activities to fit the needs of your team. Please talk to a mentor or an experienced team member about what you should do._
