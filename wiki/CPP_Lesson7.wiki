Once you understand the content, complete this assignment.

==User Info==

Write a program that asks for a user first name, last name, street number, street name, city, state, zip code, phone number, and favorite flavor of bubble gum separately. Use a structure to store this info.

Then create a menu (like the one below) to allow the user to choose which piece of data from the structure to view.  Once a selection has been made display the piece of data.

{{{
What would you like to know about //(Display first and last name here):

1. Full Address
2. Phone Number
3. Favorite flavor of bubble gum

>>> //1, 2, or 3
}}}
