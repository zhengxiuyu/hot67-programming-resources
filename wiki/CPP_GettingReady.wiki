#summary Getting Ready for C++

= Introduction =

This guided tutorial will help you learn C++. However, you cannot learn C++ effectively without actually being able to run your programs. So, you will need to download the following software.

You may also want to read the tutorial's [http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/introduction/ introductory notes] before you continue on to the next page.

As part of the effort to migrate these tutorials to our team website, I am making videos for each of these lessons. You may find them on [http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrScY8_-rKzsCmGYTbqBR_XHP6P-buTvZ the YouTube playlist].

=Note about Extras=

You may notice sections labeled 'Extra Practice' or 'Extra Reading'. These are not required, but are put there *for your benefit*. You do not need to complete them.

Extra Practice should be completed AFTER you complete the main assignment. It will not be checked unless you deem it necessary.
