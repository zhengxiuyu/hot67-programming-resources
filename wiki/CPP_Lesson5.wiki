=Assignments=

Once you understand the content, complete these assignments.

==Temperature Converter==

Write a function `celsius()` to convert degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius (The conversion formula is `°C = 5/9 * (°F - 32)`). Use it to print a Fahrenheit-to-Centigrade table for -40 to 220 degrees Fahrenheit, in increments of 10 degrees. 

Remember that %f is the `printf()` format to use for printing floating-point numbers. Also, it is important to note that the expression 5/9 is 0, so you won't want to use integer division - divide 5.0 by 9.0 instead.

===Extra Practice===
Do any of the following: 

  * Allow the user to input a desired temperature to convert
    * You can also have them input a starting number and an ending number, and get a table from that. 
      * *WARNING!* This is tricky!
  * Convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit

==Rectangle==

Write a function `createrect(int x, int y)` that creates a rectangle out of x's.

i.e.

If you call `createrect(5,4)` you will receive:
(hint, you will need to use nested `for` loops like you did in the 'Right Triangle' program.)

{{{
xxxxx
x   x
x   x
xxxxx
}}}

===Extra Practice===
Rewrite the program so that it can do any of the following:

  * Allow the user to change the size of the rectangle
  * Allow the user to create multiple rectangles in the same run (meaning the program cannot exit)
  * Allow the user to put a message in the rectangle *without* changing its dimensions (pre-defined or user-defined dimensions, but the rectangle must stay a rectangle)
