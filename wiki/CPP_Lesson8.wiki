At this point, it is hard to assign anything on pointers. Regardless, this is still one of the most important concepts in terms of robotics programming.

In the next lesson, you can write the assignment using pointers (where applicable), and, as a matter of fact, it is the better way of completing that task (due to memory issues).

If you need extra practice in the meantime, you can rewrite any previous assignment using pointers and dynamic memory.
